1. Implement buying and selling for scarcity -- BUSY (need to test)
2. Get Scarcity price of token function --BUSY
3. Slippage strategy -- DONE
4. Implement buying via scarcity. --BUSY
6. Validator determines whether scarcity can be bought or not --DONE
7. Migrations - link safeOperations and safeMath libraries
8. Tests - observe every require statement to test boundaries and remember slippage.
9. On front end play around with factor and upper limit in kovan to get the right feel. 10% initial burn might be a bit intense.
